# Academy Overview

## Purpose:
* Traditional foundation based on timeless fundamentals, physics of music, and human psychology. Adapt Nadia Boulanger's principles towards students intending to write modern media music.
* End to end - the goal of music is ultimately storytelling via sound waves reaching human ears. In modern contexts, unless you have access to live performers, this means usually creating an audio file. Sheet music is merely a tool, and you want to be able to communicate to everyone, not just people who can read music. Compose, orchestrate, and produce music as soon as possible to remove fear of the unknown. Nobody wants to be stuck doing a hundred theoretical exercises before they can write a real piece of music.
* Expose early to as many dimensions of music as possible, so student can decide where to go deeper. Fundamentals in each of these areas can always be grown in later no matter how advanced you are.

## PREREQUISITES (or starter lessons):
* You can read notes on treble and bass clef
* You can identify intervals by number (e.g. 2nd, 3rd, 5th). Naming quality (e.g. minor/major) is optional
