# Academy Overview

## Purpose:
* Traditional foundation based on timeless fundamentals, physics of music, and human psychology. Adapt Nadia Boulanger's principles towards students intending to write modern media music.
* End to end - the goal of music is ultimately storytelling via sound waves reaching human ears. In modern contexts, unless you have access to live performers, this means usually creating an audio file. Sheet music is merely a tool, and you want to be able to communicate to everyone, not just people who can read music. Compose, orchestrate, and produce music as soon as possible to remove fear of the unknown. Nobody wants to be stuck doing a hundred theoretical exercises before they can write a real piece of music.
* Expose early to as many dimensions of music as possible, so student can decide where to go deeper. Fundamentals in each of these areas can always be grown in later no matter how advanced you are.

## PREREQUISITES (or starter lessons):
* You can read notes on treble and bass clef
* You can identify intervals by number (e.g. 2nd, 3rd, 5th). Naming quality (e.g. minor/major) is optional

## Why start with counterpoint?
Human mind is designed to track numerous living organisms and aspects of the environment around us. Each entity is instinctively differentiated by how high or low its pitch is, its sound qualities or timbre, as well as its physical location in space (a sound arriving slightly sooner in one ear before the other allows us to locate the sound source in physical space). You can, for example, hear (and even comprehend) multiple conversations at once, while a siren blares in the distance, birds chirp, and leaves rustle. The sudden appearance of a sound source sticks out to us evolutionarily, to alert us of a new predator or environmental hazard. Similarly, the sudden disappearance of a sound lets us know something is wrong, like a family member falling unconscious or going missing.
